          creator at BritishPandaChick. She is best known for her blogs The

          math, and study skills to students.</p>

        <p>Sarah has been coding for the past three years. She builds WordPress
          websites for local businesss, creatives, and solopreneurs. In 2018,

          and has been featured on Skillcrush sharing her tech story.</p>

        <p>When she's not coding or blogging, Sarah can be found making
          needlecraft kits for Needlework Kits. She particularly likes to do
          felt applique, cross stitch, and embroidery. She is currently learning
          how to crochet in her spare time. Sarah also enjoys reading, watching
          cooking shows, and playing mobile games.</p>
