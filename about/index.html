            <h2>About Sarah</h2>
            <p>Sarah Bartley is a front-end web developer and content creator at
              BritishPandaChick. She consult and build WordPress websites with small
              businesses, creatives, and solopreneurs. Before she was creating web
              applications, she taught reading, math, and study skills to students.</p>

            <p>In addition to creating websites, Sarah writes posts for blogs such
              as BritishPandaChick Codes and Needlework Kits. She began blogging
              in March 2015 with her first blog The Original BritishPandaChick where
              she created the My Coding Journey series which shared everything she’s
              been learned about coding. Sarah contributed posts other platforms
              including The Practical Dev, App Academy, and Book Prescriber.</p>

            <p>When Sarah isn’t coding or blogging, she can be found making needlecraft
